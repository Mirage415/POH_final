    <h1>The Intersection of Technology and Humanity</h1>

    <p>As I reflect on my identity and how it shapes my understanding of the world, I find that my journey is deeply intertwined with the diverse experiences that have marked my life. Growing up in an era with rapid development of technologies, I was constantly navigating between evolving technology and human interests. As I learn more about them, I usually consider how technology can benefit humanity.</p>

    <p>This duality not only influenced how I perceive myself but also how I interact with and interpret the world around me.</p>

    <h2>Technology and Science: A Childhood Fascination</h2>
    <p>My identity as a new generation who was born in this era of swarming development of technology and science has played a significant role in shaping my academic interests. Just a few years after I was born, the famous movie franchise <strong>Transformers</strong> was released. Transformers is a media franchise produced by American toy company Hasbro and Japanese company TakaraTomy. It follows the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons, two alien robot factions at war that can transform into other forms, such as vehicles and animals. I was totally fascinated by the amazing design and terrific CGI of transformable giant robots, and that was when a seed of science was planted deep in my heart. At that time, I started imagining what a world we will achieve if we can bring those super-advanced alien technologies to reality.</p>

    <h2>Exploring Nature and Technology</h2>
    <p>This background has brought me a deep curiosity about man-made technological developments and human living. Though as a child I did not have much access to emergent technologies, I could start resolving this curiosity from using natural resources that I could find around me. Just as a saying by the famous natural scientist Jean-Henri Fabre goes:</p>
    <blockquote>“Let us turn elsewhere, to the wasps and bees, who unquestionably come first in the laying up of a heritage for their offspring.”</blockquote>
    <p>From my perspective, the heritage those insects could lay—not only for their offspring—but also for us might be the secrets lying amongst their behaviors that have kept their races thriving for millions of years. Hence, insects were a perfect choice for me. When I entered primary school, by a coincidence, I started researching insects. I kept a praying mantis as a pet to observe its behaviors. To keep it alive, I went into the wild to catch grasshoppers as its feed, crafting nets and sticks to make it a container to live. Slowly I recorded lots of information regarding mantises and many other kinds of insects, and with that information collected, an interesting idea jumped out of my mind: why not utilize them in inventing human-beneficial devices?</p>

    <h2>From Curiosity to Innovation</h2>
    <p>In order to ensure the nutritious needs of my pet mantises, I made an automatic feeding machine with timing devices. Once the time goes to zero, one grasshopper would be delivered to the mantis’s cage. Then an upgraded idea appeared in my mind: why don’t I simplify my device into a blueprint? In doing so, its structures can be used to build bigger machines to feed dangerous carnivorous animals in zoos, and this will reduce the risk that feeders may get hurt by animals. Based on this upgraded idea, I applied for a patent for my prototype and succeeded. This experience of making the feeding machine was my first official step up the ladder of technology.</p>

    <h2>The Role of Computer Science</h2>
    <p>With my age growing, I’ve often found myself drawn to research that examines the intersection of technologies and humanity. This interest is not just academic; it’s personal. When I entered college, I wanted to continue my journey in natural science. However, the career prospect and future development of natural and biological sciences did not satisfy me. As my knowledge of science developed, I started to realize that natural science focuses on examining existing creatures and phenomena, while computer science is the foundation of almost all emerging technologies today. To explore my interest in technology, I chose computer science as my major in college.</p>

    <h2>Applying Technology for Greater Good</h2>
    <p>With computer science knowledge mastered, I would be able to utilize it in many ways. For instance, I could create websites visible to everyone, spreading scientific knowledge to help the elderly avoid unscientific mindsets. As the saying goes:</p>
    <blockquote>“With great power comes great responsibility.”</blockquote>
    <p>When we have the potential of achieving greater good, we should hold aspirations beyond ourselves. By combining knowledge of natural science and computer science, we can contribute to humanity responsibly.</p>
